    Basic Formatting using Inline CSS
</h2>

<!-- Orange Box -->
<div style="background-color: orange; color: black; padding: 20px; margin: 20px; border: 2px solid red;">
    On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document.
    You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks.
    When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look.
    You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing a style from the Quick Styles gallery.
    Additionally, themes allow for cohesive color, font, and effect combinations, ensuring a professional and unified appearance.
    Formatting features available include font style, size, color, paragraph spacing, and text effects like shadows and outlines.

<!-- Yellow Box -->
<div style="background-color: yellow; color: darkred; padding: 20px; margin: 20px; border: 2px dashed violet; border-radius: 15px;">
    On the Insert tab, the galleries include tools for quick customization.
    These tools allow you to enhance the visual impact of your document through visually appealing headers, footers, and text boxes.
    You can also apply WordArt styles, SmartArt graphics, and predefined table styles to improve the document’s structure and readability.
    Quick access buttons streamline the application of styles and layouts, saving time and increasing consistency.
    Even complex formatting, such as columns or bordered sections, can be applied with a single click, helping maintain focus on content creation.

<!-- Pink Box -->
<div style="background-color: pink; color: darkblue; padding: 20px; margin: 20px; border: 2px solid gray;">
    The design tab provides a wide range of themes and variants that can dramatically alter the appearance of your document.
    Each theme offers a consistent set of colors, fonts, and effects that can be customized to match branding or personal preferences.
    Page background settings like borders, watermarks, and colors help differentiate sections or highlight important messages.
    Document formatting is no longer restricted to basic fonts and black-and-white text—modern documents often use color and imagery
    to emphasize content and enhance communication. Inline CSS allows for quick and specific styling of these elements without needing external stylesheets.

<!-- White Box -->
<div style="background-color: white; color: navy; padding: 20px; margin: 20px; border: 1px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); width: 95%;">
    Understanding how inline CSS works is key to controlling the appearance of web content.
    Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
    To use inline styles, add the style attribute directly within the relevant tag.
    This method is convenient for quick customizations or small projects where loading an external CSS file may be unnecessary.
    However, inline CSS should be used sparingly in large-scale web development because it can make maintenance difficult.
    Combining inline styling with other HTML formatting tools such as `<div>`, `<span>`, and semantic elements leads to powerful and flexible designs.
